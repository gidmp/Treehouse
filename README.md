# Coding project - Treehouse

## Preliminary Notes
Events happening in area via ticketmaster

As a user of the app, I want to get events happening around my area

## Project Name 
Treehouse: Find all your local concerts

## Project Description
This application will allow the user to search for nearby events happening around a person using their location. When a user selects an event, they will be shown driving directions and the cost of the drive through Uber and a weather application displaying the projected weather for the day of the event. The general application will provide a very useful way for users to either plan ahead for events or for last-minute hangouts!

## User Story
As a customer
I want information about an event
So that I can make an informed decision as to whether I want to go to it or not based on certain criteria

When I open the app

Then I will be presented with inputs that take the user's city location and preferable music genre

When I press “submit”

Then I’m presented with the concert events matching my criteria

When I click on an event

Then a new section pops up showing informations regarding the concerts, including the availabiliy, artist's past album and a button to buy the ticket concert

When I click on 'buy ticket' button

Then I am redirected to a location where I can buy the concert's ticket
