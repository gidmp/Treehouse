# Coding project - Treehouse

## Preliminary Notes
Events happening in area via ticketmaster
Uber for directions and ETAs, and cost of total
Weather gives forecast of weather of location

As a user of the app, I want to get events happening around my area

## Project Name (may change later)
Treehouse: The Most Useful Event App You’ll Ever Need :)

## Project Description
This application will allow the user to search for nearby events happening around a person using their location. When a user selects an event, they will be shown driving directions and the cost of the drive through Uber and a weather application displaying the projected weather for the day of the event. The general application will provide a very useful way for users to either plan ahead for events or for last-minute hangouts!

## User Story
As a customer
I want information about an event
So that I can make an informed decision as to whether I want to go to it or not based on certain criteria

When I open the app
Then there will be a search input OR a button to utilize my current location
When I press “submit”
Then I’m presented with the events matching my criteria
When I click on an event
Then I get directions to the event from my current location, and also get the estimated cost of the event (along with the Uber ride???)
When I click on an event
Then I am presented with the “possible” weather conditions on the day of the event

APIs to use
Ticketmaster API
Uber API
Weather API
