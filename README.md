As a customer

I want information about an event

So that I can make an informed decision as to whether I want to go to it or not based on certain criteria

When I open the app

Then I will be presented with inputs that take the user's city location and preferable music genre

When I press “submit”

Then I’m presented with the concert events matching my criteria

When I click on an event

Then a new section pops up showing informations regarding the concerts, including the availabiliy, artist's past album and a button to buy the ticket concert
